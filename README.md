# CPSC5110-Computational_Optimization

* This project addresses the problem of class scheduling to be used by students to choose their classes/courses according to their preferences. This scheduling problem involves data organization, creating mathematical models and solving the models. Each student has different preferences. The class scheduling project implements any specific choices of a particular student. One student makes a list of the courses according to his/her preferences from the online class schedule and rate them between 1 and 5. The overall rating is the weighted average of the following parameters,

  1. Content of the course based on his/her interest.
  2. Reputation of the instructor from previous experience and word of mouth.
  3. Timing of the course by avoiding morning classes.

* The objective of this project is to make a scheduler that will maximize the total rating. However, university also imposes some specific requirements/constraints over student's course selection. The problem of scheduling of the courses of student's according to his/her preferences and university constraints solved using two possible methods.
